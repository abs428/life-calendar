Introduction
------------
I found this article [on WaitButWhy.com](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html) that visualizes an average life in weeks and gives you some much needed perspective. I thought that it was a clever use of [a dotplot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_plot_(statistics)).

The scripts in this project will allow users to generate such charts with relatively little effort and relies on only the now standard plotting stack: `matplotlib`, `seaborn` and `pandas`, `numpy` for data manipulation.

The base code has been ripped off [from here](https://gist.github.com/lukauskas/f2f43aad6078a8b5d71b986174487b8c#file-scattermap-py)
